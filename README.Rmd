The goal of `tableone` is to make it easy to generate comparison tables for journal
publication. It converts a line list of experimental or observational data into
a summary table which can be grouped by an intervention. Reporting summaries of
this kind of data has to be aware of missing items, and provide summary statistics
and statistical comparisons that are appropriate for the data. This is amenable 
to some automated decision making but frequently such automation must be 
overridden. `tableone` provides an automated one command statistical summary
table the output of which is highly configurable. The resulting tables are 
in `huxtable` format ready for export into a wide range out file types.

## Installation

There is a different `tableone` package on CRAN. This package is hosted in the
[Bristol Vaccine Centre r-universe](https://https://bristol-vaccine-centre.r-universe.dev/).
Installation from there is as follows:

``` r
options(repos = c(
  "bristol-vaccine-centre" = 'https://https://bristol-vaccine-centre.r-universe.dev/',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Download and install tableone in R
install.packages("tableone")
```

You can install the development version of `tableone` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/bristol-vaccine-centre/tableone) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bristol-vaccine-centre/tableone")
```

## Example

`tableone` is there to make descriptive statistics consistent and easy. Summarising the dataset in a a nicely formatted summary table is as simple as the following code. For
the proper formatted output head to the [main documentation
website](https://bristol-vaccine-centre.github.io/tableone/).

```{r}
# hide messages 
old = options(tableone.quiet = TRUE)

# generate table 
iris %>% 
  describe_population(everything()) 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# reset options
options(old)
```

As a `huxtable` output the table can be saved as a wide range of formats from
spreadsheets or documents to latex and html (even as a github README.md with 
limited success). This default output of `tableone` can be very substantially 
customised to fit into a specific journal's requirements.
